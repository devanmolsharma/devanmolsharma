Hey everyone, welcome! 

I'm Anmol Sharma, and I'm all about building cool stuff with code. I love to explore the space where logic meets creativity and am constantly looking for new challenges to tackle. I'm especially comfortable with **Python, TypeScript, and Java**, but I'm always down to learn new things. 

If you're interested in connecting, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanmolsharma). Let's build something awesome together! âœ¨
